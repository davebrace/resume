        Hello ðŸ‘‹ - I'm a software engineer that enjoys building products and
        companies. I've spent the last eight years working at two startups. At
        the most recent startup, I've grown into the role of CTO. I lead a small
        team of engineers while working closely with the sales team, product
        team and most importantly our customers.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I have 10+ years of experience building web-based applications,
        typically with Ruby on Rails. In addition, I have several years of
        experience building a chrome extension with React & Typescript and I've
        done some iOS development as well. I enjoy working across all parts of
        the technology stack.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-12 print:mb-8">
        My technical background is complemented by my entrepreneurial and
        leadership experience. I love to help my team tackle all types of
        business problems including sales, marketing and overall company
        strategy. I particularly enjoy speaking with and learning from customers
        as I belive its critical to the success of every company.
