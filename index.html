        Hello ðŸ‘‹ - I'm a software engineer that enjoys building products and
        companies. I am an experienced full stack engineer that loves to work on
        all aspects of building web applications from the database to the
        styling on the front end. In addition to building products, I am
        interested in all aspects of building a business, from marketing and
        sales to hiring and making strategic product decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-8">
        I've spent the last eight years working at two startups. At the most
        recent startup, I've grown into the role of CTO. I lead a small team of
        engineers while working closely with the sales team, product team and
        most importantly our customers.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-8">
        Technically, I have the mostly experience in building web-based
        applications, typically run on Ruby on Rails. I have several years of
        experience building a chrome extension with React & Typescript and I've
        done some iOS development as well. I enjoy constantly improving the
        development experience for myself and my team as a whole.

              creating private repositories containing a take home project on
              GitHub for each candidate. This was very cumbersome, but the
              benefits were clear as it allowed candidates to open pull requests
              on GitHub for us to review their take home projects. This let the
              candidate demonstrate their writing communication with code and
              also allowed them to learn about our code review culture.

              corresponding file name in the current project's hierarchy based
              on the file you're currently viewing. For example, if you're
              viewing 'home_controller_spec.rb', it will search for the
              'home_controller.rb' file and open it for you.
